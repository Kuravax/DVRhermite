Discrete variable representation algorithm implemented in sinc basis (aka Chebyshev polynomials), using Fortran

Discretization of ^X^ operator (by analytically determined quadrature) which lets us simplify V(x) calculation by immediately yielding diagonal
matrix of the potential operator.

Built in plotter of stationary state wavefunctions. Some plot examples attached.

Future plans - implementing time propagating wavepacket
